o Fixing Data Input Errors
Note: 
	This might be due to using the default editor:
	BPMN2 Diagram Editor, instead of BPMN2 Process Editor
	
	See what I mean by:
	1. Show MI_Main in default BPMN2 Diagram Editor
		Select an error like: "Data Input memberFacts.." for MI_Main.bpmn2
		Right click->Show In->Package Explorer
		MI_Main.bpmn2 process is highlighted
		Double click MI_Main.bpmn2
		
		A bunch of errors appear, 
			these are saying that connectors are not set properly.
		Ignore them
		Click [Ok]

		See! No connectors are set in MI_Main
		Close Editor
		
	2. Show MI_Main in default BPMN2 Process Editor
		Right click MI_Main.bpmn2->Open With->BPMN2 Process Editor
		See! Connectors are set in MI_Main
		
		Some how, some way. I, we have to: 
		set the default editor to: BPMN2 Process Editor
		How, I don't know as of 01/27/2018.
		
	3. Ignore Errors
	A. For select all the errors and Delete.
	B. Force the use of editor: BPMN2 Process Editor
